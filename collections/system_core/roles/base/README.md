# base

The base role in the Ansible automation framework is crucial for configuring Linux workstations for audio production using open-source software. It handles core system configuration tasks such as package management, service management, OS optimizations, and bootloader settings. By establishing fundamental directory structures, environment variables, and default configurations, it ensures consistency across hosts.

This role adopts a modular architecture, organizing tasks into separate YAML files based on domains, which promotes maintainability and adaptability. It focuses on infrastructural needs and common prerequisites, allowing specialized application roles to concentrate on their primary functionality without redundant effort. The base role aims to provide a reliable, standardized configuration baseline for integrating audio production tools smoothly.

In operation, the base role continuously monitors the system, executing upgrades, verifying service health, and applying OS tweaks to maintain optimal conditions across hosts. While it may lack the glamour of digital audio workstations, its capable system administration and automation are essential for real-world productivity and stability. The base role exemplifies substance over style in systems configuration management.

The role's structure includes various directories such as defaults, files, handlers, meta, tasks, templates, tests, and vars. Main tasks are divided into subdomains, like sudoers, repos, xdg, sshd, each addressing specific configuration aspects. It ensures root directories exist for other roles, configures environment variables according to the XDG Base Directory spec, manages SSH settings, installs SSH keys, and known_hosts files, configures passwordless sudo, manages package repositories, updates packages, installs basic utility packages, configures package manager, manages the Linux kernel, configures the bootloader, installs basic services like autofs, and deploys common scripts and utilities.

In summary, the base role provides a well-structured, modular approach to establishing core OS configuration, serving as a foundation for other roles to build upon. It ensures a standardized environment across hosts, enabling efficient audio production workflows.
