# applications

The applications role in this setup is designed to handle the installation and configuration of various multimedia and creative applications on a workstation. It performs several key tasks to achieve this:

1. **Installing Packages**: The role installs available applications as packages using package definitions. These packages are typically sourced from repositories and are installed using the AUR helper, paru, based on name lists.

2. **Configuring Directories**: It ensures that configuration directories exist for applications. This is done by creating directories defined in defaults, such as ~/.sonic-pi/config, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the applications.

3. **Conditional Imports**: The role can conditionally import additional application role files. These files configure specific applications such as Reaper, VSCode, and others. This allows for a customized configuration based on the specific needs of the workstation.

4. **Downloading/Building Apps**: For applications that are not available as packages, the role can download or build them from URLs or git repositories. This ensures that even non-standard applications can be installed and configured as needed.

The role uses several key files to manage these tasks, including:

- roles/applications/tasks/main.yml
- roles/applications/vars/main.yml
- roles/applications/defaults/main.yml
- roles/applications/*.yml (app roles)

In summary, the applications role provides an automated and modular approach to provisioning a workstation with the desired creative and audio applications. It is based on variables, allowing for flexibility and customization in the installation and configuration process.
