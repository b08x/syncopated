# existing_file.results: This refers to the result of the stat task,
# which gathers information about the existence of files/directories specified in the loop parameter.

# selectattr('stat.exists', 'defined'): This filter selects the items from existing_file.results
# where the stat.exists attribute is defined. In other words, it filters out any results that don't have the stat.exists attribute.

# selectattr('stat.islnk', 'defined'): This filter further narrows down the selected items from the previous step
# by filtering only those results where the stat.islnk attribute is defined.
# This ensures that only symlink entries are considered.

# list: This filter converts the filtered results into a list format.

# length > 0: This checks if the length of the resulting list is greater than zero,
# indicating that there are existing symlink entries for the specified paths.
