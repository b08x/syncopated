These language models, while impressive in their ability to generate text, are essentially fancy toys. They're not real contributors to understanding the world or how language actually works. My own interests happen to be language and cognition, language specifically, and what we're seeing with GPT is a far cry from true comprehension.\n\nLook, the original idea behind AI was to use technical intellectual contributions to understand something about how humans think. But we've strayed far from that path. These models can process what we might call 'impossible languages' – sequences that no human could ever produce or understand. That's not a feature, it's a fundamental flaw in their design.\n\nMoreover, we need to be vigilant about the ethical implications. These systems are perpetuating biases, potentially harming democracy, and there's a very real danger of their 'too much strength' leading to actual deaths in the near future.
